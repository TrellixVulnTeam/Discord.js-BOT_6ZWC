This allows to effectively check if a lock is stale by checking its `mtime` against a stale threshold. If the update of the mtime fails several times, the lock might be compromised. The `mtime` is [supported](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems) in almost every `filesystem`.\n\n\n### Comparison\n\nThis library is similar to [lockfile](https://github.com/isaacs/lockfile) but the later has some drawbacks:\n\n- It relies on `open` with `O_EXCL` flag which has problems in network file systems. `proper-lockfile` uses `mkdir` which doesn't have this issue.\n\n> O_EXCL is broken on NFS file systems; programs which rely on it for performing locking tasks will contain a race condition.\n\n- The lockfile staleness check is done via `ctime` (creation time) which is unsuitable for long running processes. `proper-lockfile` constantly updates lockfiles `mtime` to do proper staleness check.\n\n- It does not check if the lockfile was compromised which can led to undesirable situations. `proper-lockfile` checks the lockfile when updating the `mtime`.\n\n- It has a default value of `0` for the stale option which isn't good because any crash or process kill that the package can't handle gracefully will leave the lock active forever.\n\n\n### Compromised\n\n`proper-lockfile` does not detect cases in which:\n\n- A `lockfile` is manually removed and someone else acquires the lock right after\n- Different `stale`/`update` values are being used for the same file, possibly causing two locks to be acquired on the same file\n\n`proper-lockfile` detects cases in which:\n\n- Updates to the `lockfile` fail\n- Updates take longer than expected, possibly causing the lock to became stale for a certain amount of time\n\n\nAs you see, the first two are a consequence of bad usage. Technically, it was possible to detect the first two but it would introduce complexity and eventual race conditions.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### .lock(file, [options])\n\nTries to acquire a lock on `file`.\n\nIf the lock succeeds, a `release` function is provided that should be called when you want to release the lock.\n\nAvailable options:\n\n- `stale`: Duration in milliseconds in which the lock is considered stale, defaults to `10000` (minimum value is `5000`)\n- `update`: The interval in milliseconds in which the lockfile's `mtime` will be updated, defaults to `stale/2` (minimum value is `1000`, maximum value is `stale/2`)\n- `retries`: The number of retries or a [retry](https://www.npmjs.org/package/retry) options object, defaults to `0`\n- `realpath`: Resolve symlinks using realpath, defaults to `true` (note that if `true`, the `file` must exist previously)\n- `fs`: A custom fs to use, defaults to `graceful-fs`\n- `onCompromised`: Called if the lock gets compromised, defaults to a function that simply throws the error which will probably cause the process to die\n- `lockfilePath`: Custom lockfile path. e.g.: If you want to lock a directory and create the lock file inside it, you can pass `file` as `<dir path>` and `options.lockfilePath` as `<dir path>/dir.lock`\n\n\n```js\nconst lockfile = require('proper-lockfile');\n\nlockfile.lock('some/file')\n.then((release) => {\n    // Do something while the file is locked\n\n    // Call the provided release function when you're done,\n    // which will also return a promise\n    return release();\n});\n\n// Alternatively, you may use lockfile('some/file') directly.\n```\n\n\n### .unlock(file, [options])\n\nReleases a previously acquired lock on `file`.\n\nWhenever possible you should use the `release` function instead (as exemplified above). Still there are cases in which its hard to keep a reference to it around code. In those cases `unlock()` might be handy.\n\nAvailable options:\n\n- `realpath`: Resolve symlinks using realpath, defaults to `true` (note that if `true`, the `file` must exist previously)\n- `fs`: A custom fs to use, defaults to `graceful-fs`\n- `lockfilePath`: Custom lockfile path. e.g.: If you want to lock a directory and create the lock file inside it, you can pass `file` as `<dir path>` and `options.lockfilePath` as `<dir path>/dir.lock`\n\n\n```js\nconst lockfile = require('proper-lockfile');\n\nlockfile.lock('some/file')\n.then(() => {\n    // Do something while the file is locked\n\n    // Later..\n    return lockfile.unlock('some/file');\n});\n```\n\n### .check(file, [options])\n\nCheck if the file is locked and its lockfile is not stale.\n\nAvailable options:\n\n- `stale`: Duration in milliseconds in which the lock is considered stale, defaults to `10000` (minimum value is `5000`)\n- `realpath`: Resolve symlinks using realpath, defaults to `true` (note that if `true`, the `file` must exist previously)\n- `fs`: A custom fs to use, defaults to `graceful-fs`\n- `lockfilePath`: Custom lockfile path. e.g.: If you want to lock a directory and create the lock file inside it, you can pass `file` as `<dir path>` and `options.lockfilePath` as `<dir path>/dir.lock`\n\n\n```js\nconst lockfile = require('proper-lockfile');\n\nlockfile.check('some/file')\n.then((isLocked) => {\n    // isLocked will be true if 'some/file' is locked, false otherwise\n});\n```\n\n### .lockSync(file, [options])\n\nSync version of `.lock()`.   \nReturns the `release` function or throws on error.\n\n### .unlockSync(file, [options])\n\nSync version of `.unlock()`.   \nThrows on error.\n\n### .checkSync(file, [options])\n\nSync version of `.check()`.\nReturns a boolean or throws on error.\n\n\n## Graceful exit\n\n`proper-lockfile` automatically remove locks if the process exists, except if the process is killed with SIGKILL or it crashes due to a VM fatal error (e.g.: out of memory).\n\n\n## Tests\n\n`$ npm test`   \n`$ npm test -- --watch` during development\n\nThe test suite is very extensive. There's even a stress test to guarantee exclusiveness of locks.\n\n\n## License\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\n",
